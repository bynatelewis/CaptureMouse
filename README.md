# CaptureMouse 🖱️
CaptureMouse is a lightweight, cross-platform utility for recording Vector2 coordinate data from your mouse movements and storing it in a plain text file.

## 🎯 Why CaptureMouse?
I developed this as an elegant solution for tracking mouse movements in screen-recorded demonstration videos. However, the captured data can also be used for other applications that utilize plain text Vector2 data, such as motion tracking, UI testing, or sensor-driven applications.
